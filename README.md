# Smart Traffic Light Detection System Project

## How to Run?
The main result is from the code [here](ProjectTestVideo.py) using the data from this [folder](best.pt).
The example output is in the same [folder](TestVideo_Output.mp4).

## Which code is which?
Training the final YOLO model is this [code](Project.ipynb).
Training the final Random Forest Classifier model is this [code](ProjectRandomForest.ipynb).
The other 2 folders are the imported dataset and the format conversion codes.
The raw dataset is not included as it is too large.
